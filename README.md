# gif_composite

Tool for compositing two gifs overtop each other via the command line.

I'm uploading this project largely for my own reference.
It's extremely limited in what it accepts, to the point where it is likely very difficult to use effectively.
**If you're looking for a Solution, this tool is likely not it.**
